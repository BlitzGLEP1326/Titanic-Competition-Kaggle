Titanic-Competition-Kaggle
==========================
Follow an introduction Getting-Started-with-R tutorial from trevorstephens:
http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r

This tutorial includes:
Part 1: Booting Up R
Part 2: The Gender-Class Model
Part 3: Decision Trees
Part 4: Feature Engineering
Part 5: Random Forests

It introduces Decision Trees and Random Forests machine learning algorithms, which I need to dive into it some days later.

Feature Engineering is kind of a method that needs to involve one's intutive sense toward the actual dataset.
One needs to look at the original dataset and variables and generate a new set of features from it.
I guess this is the so-called "part of art, part of science"skill in Data Science

This project is still in progress.
